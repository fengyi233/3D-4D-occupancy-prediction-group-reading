## Title

### Abstract

a 3D sparse diffuser




### Motivation

Previous methods typically construct dense 3D volumes, neglecting the inherent sparsity of the scene and suffering from high computational costs.

Operating on dense latent spaces introduces a cubic time and space complexity, which limits scalability in terms of perception range or spatial resolution.

Existing approaches compress the dense representation using projections like Birdâ€™s Eye View (BEV) or Tri-Perspective View (TPV). Although efficient, these projections result in information loss, especially for tasks like semantic occupancy prediction.
